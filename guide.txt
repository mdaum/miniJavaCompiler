Comp 520 Project Maxwell Daum

Scope:
	-due to time constraints with my other project-based cs courses I only had time to
	polish up the basic compiler. No known limitations with my implementation.


AST Changelog:

    -added nullLiteral.java
    -added visitNullLiteral to Visitor interface
    -updated ASTDisplay to reflect this

   - Declaration attributes added to Identifier and Reference

    -added SourcePosition to Identifier for better Error Reporting
    -added isArrayLength bool to FieldDecl for easier checking of edge case
    -added RuntimeEntity entity to Declaration.java for codeGen
	
Test Description:
	-Most of my testing was pretty much mutating existing test cases provided from previous
	checkpoints, since this was case specific in hindsight I should of held on to these mutations
	for regression purposes. However, I overwrote the one test my compiler spammed on each part for most of this project.
	For simply testing functionality within the classroom server I have included the pa4 tests
	as well as the failure tests from previous regression sets...
