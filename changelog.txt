ChangeLog: Two things that resulted in a number of cases being wrong....

1. Line 358 Identification.java: I neglected to consider a reference to a private class while not in said class whilst dealing with a static context

2. Line 402 TypeChecker.java: this is the big one. Forgot to handle typeEquivalence with null, resulted in a huge number of errors!

3. Line 456-459 Identification.java: Using this within a static context.



After changing these two things I went from failing over 60 tests to just 2. Apologies for these three small mistakes!
